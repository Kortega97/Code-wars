// Number toString
// this code is iving an err

var a = (123).toString();

// My head is at the wrong end!

// You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

// Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

// Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

function fixTheMeerkat(arr) {
    return arr.reverse() //your code here 
    }
